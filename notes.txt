We have to create a virtual environment as we need to import many packages

before all we need to do
brew install portaudio for macOS

Packages:
speech recognition pyaudio
setuptools
webbrowser(default installed) -- built in module
pyttsx3 ---- text to speech 
pocketsphinx ---- for audio recognition
pygame --- for mp3 loading


First we have to create a Recognizer object ---- for speech recognition
How ----
import speech recognition as sr
recognizer = sr.Recognizer() #Creating object

Then we have to initialize pyttsx3 ---- for text to speech
How ----
import pyttsx3
engine = pyttsx3.init()

Then we can do text to speech by
engine.say("......Speech......")
engine.runAndWait()



Microphone recognition:
How -----
# obtain audio from the microphone
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
with sr.Microphone() as source:
    print("Say something!")
    audio = r.listen(source , timeout = 2 , phrase_time_limit = 1) 
    # timeout is a parameter which defines how much time the recognizer will wait to start a phrase before throwing an Exception
    # phrase_time_limit is a parameter which defines upto how much time it will wait for listening to your phrase

# recognize speech using google audio recognition
try:
    command = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
    print(command)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)



How to check for desired command -----
Eg ---
if "jarvis" in command.lower():
    print("Activating Jarvis")



How to open web browser applications -----
def process(command):
    if "open google" in command.lower():
        webbrowser.open("https://google.com")

and so on.....
We can give any valid link to it and it will play it


Letting OpenAI handle the request......
We have to download OpenAI API and import it
pip install openai

Making API request ----
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4o-mini",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a poetic assistant, skilled in explaining complex programming concepts with creative flair."},
    {"role": "user", "content": command}
  ]
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content) #prints the content

#####FUCK IT IS PAID.....I will do it when I have the money bro


gTTS ----- better speech recognition but PAID

Playing mp3 files -----
First install and import pygame
import pygame
Initialize it ----- pygame.mixer.init()
Load the mp3 file ----- pygame.mixer.music.load("your file.mp3")
Play the mp3 file ------ pygame.mixer.music.play()

Keeping the program running until the music stops Playing -----
while pygame.mixer.music.get_busy():
    pygame.time.Clock().tick(10)
